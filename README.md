# ClangIR (CIR)

ClangIR is a high-level representation in Clang that reflects aspects of the C/C++
languages and their extensions. It is implemented using MLIR and occupies a position
between Clang's AST and LLVM IR.

The project is incubated under LLVM's GitHub
[umbrella](https://github.com/llvm) and is being [upstreamed](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/labels/ClangIR)
to the llvm-project (LLVM's official main repository).

GitHub incubator repo: [llvm/clangir](https://github.com/llvm/clangir).

for updates and [ClangIR in practice](https://llvm.github.io/clangir/Development/pipeline.html) for a tool overview. Also see
[motivation and history](https://llvm.github.io/clangir/Development/motivation.html)
for extra context about the project.

# Where to go from here?

Check out the docs for [contributing to the
project](https://llvm.github.io/clangir/GettingStarted/contrib.html) and dive
into the [CIR Dialect](https://llvm.github.io/clangir/Dialect/),
list of [CIR passes](https://llvm.github.io/clangir/Dialect/passes.html) in Clang or the ClangIR [pipeline](https://llvm.github.io/clangir/Development/pipeline.html).

### Inspiration

ClangIR is inspired in the success of other languages that greatly benefit from
a middle-level IR, such as
[Swift](https://apple-swift.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SIL.html) and
[Rust](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/mir/index.html). Particularly,
optionally attaching AST nodes to CIR operations is inspired by SIL references
to AST nodes in Swift.
