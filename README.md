#fffff2 55 ClangIR (CIR)

ClangIR is a new IR for Clang, which is an MLIR dialect for C/C++ based
languages in Clang. Its representation level sits somewhere between
Clang's AST and LLVM IR.

ClangIR [upstreaming
RFC](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-upstreaming-clangir/76587) was
[accepted](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-upstreaming-clangir/76587/46?u=bcardosolopes)
in Feb 2024, and we already started the upstreaming
[work](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/labels/ClangIR). Development is
still currently done in the [incubator](https://github.com/llvm/clangir) but
shall move to upstream as soon as the bulk of the base work lands.

# Motivation

In a gist, an IR that can cover C/C++ higher level semantics enables a class of
idiomatic diagnostics and performance optimizations that are hard to
explore on Clang AST or LLVM IR level.

By using MLIR, ClangIR leverages a compiler framework to write passes, IR and quickly
iterate design, while re-using community provided analysis and transformations that can
be easily adapted for CIR.

# What's ClangIR in practice?

ClangIR is an MLIR dialect that is also bound to Clang, meaning it lives inside
the clang project and not as an MLIR in-tree dialect. Some CIR operations
optionally contain backreferences to the Clang AST, enabling analysis and
transformation passes to optionally use AST information, while also allowing
progressive lowering through late use of AST nodes.

By passing `-fclangir` to the clang driver, the compilation pipeline is
modified and CIR gets emitted from Clang's AST and then lowered to LLVM IR,
backend, etc. To get CIR printed out of a compiler invocation, the flag
`-emit-cir` can be used, which will force the compiler to stop right after CIR
is produced. The picture below depicts how the compiler pipeline works:

See
[instructions](https://llvm.github.io/clangir/GettingStarted/build-install.html)
on how to build clang with ClangIR support and checkout [some
examples](https://llvm.github.io/clangir/GettingStarted/examples.html). 

# Current status

The project is active, here's a list of the current supported pieces:

- CIRGen: the process of generating CIR out of the Clang AST. We support a good
set of functionality from C/C++, but there are many missing. The
[CIR/CodeGen](https://github.com/llvm/clangir/tree/main/clang/test/CIR/CodeGen)
test directory is a good proxy of the current supported features.

- LLVM lowering: generating LLVM IR out of CIR. About 50% of all programs in
`llvm-testsuite/SingleSource` pass correctness checks.

- MLIR in-tree dialect lowering: basically CIR -> MLIR dialects, initial
support to memref and some other dialects but currently not as active as LLVM
lowering.

- Lifetime checker: implementation of a C++ lifetime checker (for catching C++
dangling pointers) based in [C++ lifetime safety
paper](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1179r1.pdf).
Currently handles pointer/owner/aggregate type categories, lambda dangling
references via captures and can also catch idiomatic cases of dangling
references in coroutines `coawait` expressions.

# Inspiration

ClangIR is inspired in the success of other languages that greatly benefit from
a middle-level IR, such as
[Swift](https://apple-swift.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SIL.html) and
[Rust](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/mir/index.html). Particularly,
optionally attaching AST nodes to CIR operations is inspired by SIL references
to AST nodes in Swift.

# Github project

This project is part of the LLVM incubator, the source of truth for CIR is found at
[https://github.com/llvm/clangir](https://github.com/llvm/clangir).

The [main](https://github.com/facebookincubator/clangir/tree/main) branch
contains a stack of commits, occasionally rebased on top of LLVM upstream,
tracked in
[base](https://github.com/llvm/clangir/tree/base)
branch.
