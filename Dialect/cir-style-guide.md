# ASM Style Guide

## Naming Convention

The name of a type, an attribute, or an operation should be in `snake_case` .
Examples:

```mlir
!cir.int
!cir.long_double<!cir.float>
!cir.data_member
#cir.cmp3way_info
#cir.dyn_cast_info
cir.binop
cir.get_member
```

The name of a type parameter, an attribute parameter, or an operation argument
and result, when defined in TableGen and printed in CIR assembly, should be in
`snake_case` .

Any keywords that appears in the syntax of a type, an attribute, or an
operation, should be in `snake_case` .

## Assembly Syntax Convention

### General Syntax Format

Each operation should follow the following general syntax:

```mlir
cir.op <args> <regions> `:` <typing> <attr>
```

Where:

- `<args>` is the operation’s arguments list.
- `<regions>` is any regions introduced by the operation.
- `<typing>` is the operation’s type specifications.
- `<attrs>` is any attributes attached to the operation.

### Arguments List

The arguments list should include all the arguments (except for some attributes
as specified in the “placement of attribute” section later) to the operation.
Don't use parenthesis around the arguments list. The most common format of an
arguments list is just a comma-separated list:

```mlir
%3 = cir.libc.memchr %0, %1, %2 : (!cir.ptr<!cir.void>, !s32i, !u64i) -> !cir.ptr<!cir.void>
```

Beyond that, one can also use auxiliary keywords and some mini-syntaxes in the
arguments list to make the operation’s assembly more readable:

```mlir
cir.store %0 to %1 : !s32i, !cir.ptr<!s32i>
%2 = cir.get_runtime_member %0[%1] : (!cir.ptr<!struct>, !cir.data_member<!s32i in !struct>) -> !cir.ptr<!s32i>
```

### Regions

For operations that introduces regions, the regions should follow the arguments
list in the assembly. One may use auxiliary keywords in the region list to make
the assembly more readable:

```mlir
cir.if %0 {
  ...
} else {
  ...
} : !cir.bool
```

```mlir
cir.ternary %2 true {
  ...
  cir.yield %0 : !s32i
} false {
  ...
  cir.yield %1 : !s32i
} : !cir.bool -> !s32i
```

### Type Specifications

The type specification gives the types of operation operands and results. Type
specifications are placed after the regions list (if any), separated from it
with a colon.

If the operation has trait `SameOperandsAndResultType` or `AllTypesMatch` , the
type specification should only give a single type that represents the type of
the operands and the results:

```mlir
%1 = cir.cos %0 : !cir.float
%2 = cir.binop add %0, %1 : !s32i
```

Otherwise, the type specification can be further split into two type lists
separated by a right arrow ( `->` ). Before the arrow is a type list for the
operands, and after the arrow is a type list for the results. Types in a type
list are separated by commas; when a type list includes more than one type,
surround the type list with a parenthesis. If at least one of the two type
lists are empty, the empty type list(s) and the right arrow can be omitted.

If the operation has trait `SameTypeOperands` , the type list for the operands
should only has one type that give the type of the operands:

```mlir
%2 = cir.ptr_diff %0, %1 : !cir.ptr<!s32i> -> !u64i
```

Otherwise, the type specification should include a type for each of the
operands and the results. Examples:

```mlir
%2 = cir.get_runtime_member %0[%1] : (!cir.ptr<!struct>, !cir.data_member<!s32i in !struct>) -> !cir.ptr<!s32i>
```

### Placement of Attributes

Attributes on an operation can be classified into the following 2 categories:

1. **Required attributes**. These attributes are required to build a valid
   operation. Missing of these attributes either makes the operation meaningless
   or breaks some passes in the CIR pipeline. Note that `UnitAttr` should be
   regarded as a boolean attribute for the purpose of classification.
2. **Optional attributes**. These attributes can always be safely removed from
   the operation, without breaking anything in CIR.

#### Required Attributes

Put required attributes in the argument list. One may place the attribute at
any appropriate position within the argument list to make the assembly
readable. Example:

```mlir
%0 = cir.const #cir.int<42> : !s32i
%1 = cir.unary inc %0 : !s32i
%2 = cir.binop add %0, %1 : !s32i
```

If the attribute is too long in its assembly form (longer than just a keyword or
an attribute name), one should define an alias for the attribute:

```mlir
#dyn_cast_info_1 = #cir.dyn_cast_info<...>
#cmp3wayinfo = #cir.cmp3way_info<...>

%1 = cir.dyn_cast ptrcast %0 #dyn_cast_info_1 : !cir.ptr<!struct> -> !cir.ptr<!cir.void>
%2 = cir.cmp3way %0, %1 #cmp3wayinfo : !s32i -> !u8i
```

#### Optional Attributes

Put optional attributes in the `<attrs>` part with the `attr-dict` TableGen
directive:

```mlir
cir.global external @foo = #cir.int<42> : !s32i #cir.ast
```

> Note that the above example categories a `VarDecl` AST reference to a global
> variable declaration node as an optional attribute. But not all AST reference
> attributes are "optional"; you should categorize each specific attribute
> according to the conventions listed before.

## Current Status

The status quo doesn't implement this full guide just yet, but while we convert
more code to use it, new entities added to the dialect shall follow this guide.
