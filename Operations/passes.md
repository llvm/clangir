### `-cir-lifetime-check`: Check lifetime safety and generate diagnostics
This pass relies on a lifetime analysis pass and uses the diagnostics
mechanism to report to the user. It does not change any code.

#### Options
```
-history : List of history styles to emit as part of diagnostics. Supported styles: {all|null|invalid}
-remarks : List of remark styles to enable as part of diagnostics. Supported styles: {all|pset}
```
### `-cir-merge-cleanups`: Remove unnecessary branches to cleanup blocks
Canonicalize pass is too aggressive for CIR when the pipeline is
used for C/C++ analysis. This pass runs some rewrites for scopes,
merging some blocks and eliminating unnecessary control-flow.
